SyFramework is a PHP framework for fast development of web applications.
It allows you to build your application as a tree of simpler components and each of them can be considered as small web-micro application which can be embedded into another application or even into another component.

## Getting started

### Requirements

A web server supporting PHP 5.3.0 or higher.

### Installation

1. Download SyFramework here.
2. Unpack the downloaded package into a directory on your web server.

### Quick start

To use SyFramework classes you just need to include the sy.inc.php file.

```php
<?php
require '/path/to/your/syframework/directory/sy.inc.php';

use Sy\Component\Html\Page;

$page = new Page();
$page->setTitle('Page example');
$page->setBody('Hello world!');
echo $page;
```

This script will generate the following output:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="utf-8" />
<title>Page example</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello world!
</body>
</html>
```
